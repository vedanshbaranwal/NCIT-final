- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations and database management
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration for development/production modes

#### File Structure
```
├── client/          # Frontend React application

├── shared/          # Shared types and schemas
├── migrations/      # Database migration files
└── attached_assets/ # Design specifications and requirements
```

The application uses a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code, enabling type safety across the full stack while maintaining clean architecture boundaries.
