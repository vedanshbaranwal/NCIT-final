"Hi! I’ve already built a gig platform website in React using replit. The platform is called 'जरूरी छ – आवश्यकतामा रोजगार', and it connects users with local service providers like electricians, plumbers, cleaners, etc. I now want to connect Supabase as the backend. Please help me integrate Supabase into my existing site for user management, worker listings, booking management, and data storage. Also guide me through setting up database tables, connecting authentication, and building workflows for both users and workers. I also want to know how I can automate backend actions using tools like Make.com or Zapier if needed."

✅ Core Functionalities I Want in the Website:
1. 🔐 Authentication (via Supabase)
Login / Signup for Users

Separate portal/login type for:

Customers

Service Providers (Workers)

Store basic info (name, email, phone, role)

2. 📇 Worker Registration & Management
Form for service providers to register

Store fields:

Name, Phone, Address

Type of work (dropdown or multiselect)

Location

Verification Documents (file/image upload)

Status: pending, approved, rejected

Admin Dashboard (or Airtable integration) to view and approve registrations

3. 📍 Service Booking System
User selects location, service, time, and confirms

Connects with available workers (filtered by service & location)

Option to assign job manually or automatically

Save bookings in Supabase:

UserID

WorkerID

Service Type

Time

Status (pending, confirmed, completed)

4. 📦 Order / Booking Dashboard
For Users: See their bookings (upcoming, history)

For Workers: See assigned jobs and their statuses

5. ⭐ Rating & Review System
After job is completed, user can submit a review

Store reviews in Supabase tied to WorkerID

6. 🧠 Admin Controls
View all bookings and registrations

Approve/Reject workers

Manually assign bookings if needed

7. 🌐 Language Toggle (Nepali ↔ English) (Optional but great UX)
🔄 Automation Integration (Optional Now, Powerful Later)
Use Make.com (preferred over Zapier for free-tier flexibility) to:

Auto-send emails to workers when new jobs come in

Notify users when booking is confirmed

Auto-approve or move data to Google Sheets/Airtable

Link API keys & Supabase URL in .env

Setup Supabase authentication
