You are an expert web developer and designer. Create a modern, fully functional, clean and minimal web app prototype for a service-based platform named **"‡§ú‡§∞‡•Ç‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§õ - ‡§Ü‡§µ‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡§§‡§æ‡§Æ‡§æ ‡§∞‡•ã‡§ú‡§ó‡§æ‡§∞"**, targeted for Nepal, that connects customers with menial workers like electricians, plumbers, cleaners, etc. It‚Äôs like a Nepali version of Urban Company, and supports SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth).

üß† Core User Flows:
1. **For Customers:**
   - Select location
   - Select or search service (electrician, plumber, AC repair, etc.)
   - View service providers
   - Add service to cart
   - Checkout with COD or Online Payment
   - Order placed: Show ‚ÄúService is on the way‚Äù

2. **For Workers (Job Accepting Flow):**
   - Profile creation with skills and service areas
   - System checks for matching jobs nearby (use Supabase location data)
   - Auto-assign to nearby top-matching workers
   - Worker receives notification via SMS/WhatsApp (use Zapier or Make.com)
   - Worker accepts/rejects job

üì¶ Tech Stack:
- Use **Supabase** for backend (user data, jobs, services, locations)
- Use **Bolt AI** to build UI and frontend logic
- Responsive and clean design using Tailwind CSS or similar
- Forms for service booking and worker sign-up
- Show basic dashboards for both customers and workers
- Minimal homepage with: Logo, Slogan, ‚ÄúBook a Service‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI want to Work‚Äù buttons
- Navigation bar and footer

üîó External Integration Plan:
- Use **Zapier** or **Make.com** to send WhatsApp/SMS notification to workers when job is assigned
- Optional: Connect with **Twilio** for direct SMS
- Payment can be simulated (no gateway required for prototype)

üí° Design Style:
- Keep it **minimal, modern and Nepali-localized**
- Use icons for services (plumber, electrician, etc.)
- Add hero section: ‚ÄúYour local helping hands, just a click away.‚Äù
- Use modern typography, large CTAs, hover effects
- Use location-aware services UI

üß™ MVP Goals:
- Website should work end-to-end for booking and worker job alerts
- No need for fancy admin panel now
- Focus on clean UX and function over polish

Use TailwindCSS style design. 
Make the layout clean, grid-based with rounded buttons, soft shadows, and large icons for each service (e.g., plumber, electrician, AC repair). Use a Nepali font option for headings, and an English clean sans-serif for body text. 
Design with accessibility and mobile responsiveness in mind.
