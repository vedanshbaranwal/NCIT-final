  AI-Powered Gig Economy Platform for Nepal

Project Overview:

Jaruri Xa is an innovative platform designed to connect skilled service workers
with clients, focusing especially on workers who do not have smartphones or reliable
internet access. By leveraging AI, automated voice calls, and SMS, Jaruri Xa bridges
the digital divide, enabling workers to receive and accept job offers instantly
without needing any advanced technology.

Key Features:
-------------
- AI-driven job matching system that pairs clients with the most suitable workers.
- Automated voice calls and SMS notifications for workers to receive job alerts.
- No smartphone or app required for workers to participate.
- Partnership with NGOs and training centers for skill verification and credibility badges.
- Real-time booking confirmation and seamless client-worker communication.
- Supports local economies by empowering marginalized gig workers.
