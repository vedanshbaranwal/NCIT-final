# Jaruri Xa

## AI-Powered Gig Economy Platform for Nepal

---

## Overview  
Jaruri Xa is an AI-powered platform built to bridge the gap between local skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers in Nepal and the people who need their services. It leverages automated voice calls, SMS notifications, and AI-driven workflows to empower workers without smartphones or consistent internet access, creating an inclusive gig economy ecosystem.

The platform connects clients with workers for common household and maintenance services such as electricians, plumbers, cleaners, cooks, and more — simplifying access to trusted help while creating job opportunities for marginalized communities.

## Social Impact & Problem Solved  

Nepal's informal sector consists of millions of workers in menial and gig jobs who often lack smartphone access or digital literacy, making it difficult for them to find consistent work or connect with customers. Simultaneously, many customers struggle to find reliable service providers in their localities, wasting time and resources.

Jaruri Xa addresses this challenge by:  
- **Digitally empowering marginalized workers** through AI-driven automation that uses SMS and voice calls, eliminating the need for smartphones or internet access.  
- **Boosting local economies** by increasing job opportunities for semi-skilled and unskilled workers in their own communities.  
- **Improving service access** for customers by providing a seamless, easy-to-use platform to book trusted professionals quickly.  
- **Promoting formalization** of gig work via verified profiles, transparent ratings, and partnerships with NGOs for skill validation.  
- **Supporting Sustainable Development Goal #8** — Decent Work and Economic Growth — by enabling fair, accessible employment opportunities for all.  

In essence, Jaruri Xa creates an inclusive digital marketplace that benefits both workers and clients, fostering economic growth and social equity.
